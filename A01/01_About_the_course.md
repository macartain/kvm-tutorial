#### About the Course

In this course, we're going to explore *KVM Virtualization on Linux* from *four* perspectives:

1. *Workstation Virtualization* Using **Rocky 9**
  - *Virtual Machine Manager (virt-manager)*
2. *Web-based Virtualization* Using **Rocky 9**
  - *Cockpit / Web Console*
3. *CLI Administration* Using **Rocky 9**


#### Course Prerequisites

**Student must be experienced / proficient with:**

- Linux:
  - Command line
  - GUI
  - Networking
  - Storage
- Exposure to RHEL distributions a plus:
  - 'dnf' / ‘yum’ - package management
- Hardware:
  - Intel (VT-x)
  - AMD (AMD-V)
- Intermediate Networking Skills
- Intermediate Storage Skills
- Virtualization Experience is a plus

**Hardware/software requirements to follow along:**

- Computer(s):
  - Intel CPU with **VT-x**
  - AMD CPU with **AMD-V**
  - Plenty of RAM
  - The more cores, the merrier
  - Reasonable disk space

- Alternative Hypervisor:
  - *Nested virtualization support*
  - Self-supported:
    - Lessons to assist with setup

**I'm using:**

- One **HP** workstation:
  - Single i5 CPU
  - 28GB RAM
  - 3 SSDs (1x 256GB for the OS and 2x 500GB for VMs)
  - Two network connections:
    - "Public" Network
    - "Private" Network

***Students will need to be patient***

- Virtualization can mean installs take time:
  - Get up and stretch
  - Get a snack
  - Bio breaks
  - Review past lessons
  - Get refreshed for when the action resumes

In this course, I've aspired to provide an interesting journey through four scenarios that utilize ***KVM Virtualization on Linux***.
