### What is Virtualization?

Red Hat: "Virtualization is technology that lets you create useful IT services using resources that are traditionally bound to hardware. It allows you to use a physical machineâ€™s full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments."

***Virtualization allows you to decouple your services and applications from the physical (server) layer, and deploy it in a more efficient and reliable manner than the traditional 1:1 service/application to physical server relationship.***
